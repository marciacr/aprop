Area of Mandelbrot Set (2) (Group Evaluation #2)

  1. Implement the parallel function to calculate the area of the Mandelbrot Set, with Rayon libraries.

  2. Using Instant and Duration from the std::time module, compare the elapsed time of the implementation (also with the Threadpool implementation of exercise 2 and the sequential implementation of PL4). What can you conclude?

  3. Compare also with the OpenMP implementations. What can you conclude?
